# Chapter 2


## Technical requirements

In this chapter we will learn Docker Engine concepts. We provide some labs at the end of the chapter that will help you understand and learn shown concepts. These labs can be run on your laptop or PC using the provided vagrant standalone environment or any already deployed Docker host at your own.

You will need at least (all labs were tested on Linux and Windows):
    
- Internet connection.    
    
- Some Linux, MacOS or Windows basic skills to edit files (using Notepad, Vim, Emacs or any other editor).
    
- Git command-line, Vagrant and Virtualbox installed on your PC or laptop.
    
- Already cloned book's repository [https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Docker-Certified-Associate-DCA-Exam-Guide.git](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Docker-Certified-Associate-DCA-Exam-Guide.git).

- Enough hardware resources: 1vCPU, 3GB of RAM and 10 GB of available disk space on your hard drive for virtual nodes.

Extended instructions can be found on Github book's repository. These labs will use "environments/standalone-environment" folder for the creation of the virtual environment and "labs/chapter2" folder.
To clone book's repository [https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Docker-Certified-Associate-DCA-Exam-Guide.git](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Docker-Certified-Associate-DCA-Exam-Guide.git), prepare a directory on your laptop or PC and execute git clone https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Docker-Certified-Associate-DCA-Exam-Guide.git. This will dowload all required files on your current folder.

All labs will start executing vagrant up  using your command-line from the environment directory "environments/standalone-environment". This command will start all the required nodes for you. If you are using your own Docker host, you can move directly to "labs/chapter2" folder.

Once all environment nodes are up and running, go to "labs/chapter2" folder and follow each lab instructions.

This environment will be used for labs from chapter 1 to chapter 6. You can keep it on your host stopped, not cosumming RAM and CPU resources. You can execute vagrant halt to stop running virtual node. This will not remove your environment and you will be able to continue using it on next chapter's labs.

After completed the labs, you can use vagrant destroy -f from "environments/standalone-environment" directory to completely remove all the lab-deployed nodes and free your disk.

## Previous requirements
- Working Vagrant and VirtualBox installation.
- Running "Standalone" environemnt.

>NOTE:
>
>You can use your own host (laptop or server), we provide you mock environments to avoid any change in your system.
